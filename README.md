# Introduction to scRNA-seq and Data Preprocessing
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Department of Data Sciences 

Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core (HBC)

Training Workshop, 10/23/2024  

Jeremy M. Simon, Ph.D  
Senior Research Scientist, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health  

# Background
There are many useful applications of single-cell or single-nucleus RNA-seq technologies to better understand cancer biology. In this introductory workshop, we will discuss 
some of the advantages of adopting single-cell approaches, frequently utilized technologies/platforms, best practices for experimental design, and provide an overview of 
algorithms used for data preprocessing. We will then provide an interactive demonstration of single-cell/single-nucleus RNA-seq data preprocessing with 
[`alevin-fry`](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/alevin-fry), resulting in a counts matrix ready for downstream analysis
